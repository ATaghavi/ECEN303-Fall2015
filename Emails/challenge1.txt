Hello,

You will find below a link to Programming Challenge 1. As part of this exercise, you are asked to program coin flips. Programming Challenge 1 is due on: Tuesday, September 15, online. As usual, you are encouraged to work in groups, yet you need to submit your own python code.

Regards,
Jean-Francois Chamberland
