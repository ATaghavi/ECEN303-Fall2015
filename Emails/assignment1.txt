Hello,

You will find attached to this email Assignment 1, which should be rather straightforward. As part of this exercise, you are asked to read the first two chapters in the notes. This may be required to complete some of the problems. Assignment 1 is due on: Thursday, September 10, at the beginning of lecture. In attempting problems, keep in mind that most of the learning is in the trying, and a large part of assignment grading is based on participation. Also, you are encouraged to work in groups, yet you need to submit your own solution.

Regards,
Jean-Francois Chamberland
