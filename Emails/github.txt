Hello,

To help you develop better insight into probability, Random Signals and Systems will feature Python programming challenges. As I mentioned before, the main site for this course is a git repository hosted on GitHub:

	https://github.com/CourseReps/ECEN303-Fall2015

On this site, you will find a course description along with pedagogical objectives. Under Tasks, you will find a synopsis of the tools needed to partake in programming activities. Tasks and programming challenges will be submitted through GitHub. As such, you are required to Sign Up for GitHub; this is free. You should do this rapidly and send me an email with your GitHubID, as you will need write access to our repository to submit work. The subject line of your email should read "ECEN303 - GitHubID". While you are at it, you may want to get the student developer pack (free for students).

Tasks 1 & 2 should be completed by Wednesday, September 2; and Task 3 should be completed by Tuesday, September 8. These tasks aim at transforming your personal computer into a world-class development station. Luckily, the necessary tools are either available for free, or are made accessible to you through educational licenses. You do NOT need to purchase software for the course.

We will devote part of the recitation session on Wednesday, September 2, to troubleshooting issues that may arise.

Good Luck,
Jean-Francois Chamberland
